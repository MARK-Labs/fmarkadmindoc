# Manage Partners on Impact&trade;

Impact&trade is the web portal for your social partners to communicate their work with you. In order to get started, you will need to invite administrators to the Impact&trade platform.

## Accessing the page

To access this page, select "Organisations" from the "Settings" menu.

## Inviting a Partner

To invite a partner, enter the email of the administator and the name of the partner. This will send them an email to invite them to use Impact&trade. They will be provided instructions for completing their registration.

## Pending Invitations

Once a partner has been invited, they will appear under Pending Invitations. To cancel the invitation click on the ![cross icon](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Delete Icon"). If this is done prior to them completing their registration, they will not be able to register. To resend the invitation, click on the ![recycle icon](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Resend Icon").

## Confirmed Invitations

Once the user has confirmed their invitation, they will appear under the Confirmed Invitations list.
