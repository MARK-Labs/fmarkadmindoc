## Accessing the page

To access this page, select "Partners" from the "Settings" menu.

## Inviting a Partner

To invite a partner, enter the email of the administator and the name of the partner. This will send them an email to invite them to use Impact&trade. They will be provided instructions for completing their registration.

## Pending Invitations

Once a partner has been invited, they will appear under Pending Invitations. To cancel the invitation click on the ![cross icon](https://d3e1wbkfmk6n2w.cloudfront.net/fa/cross.png "Delete Icon").
