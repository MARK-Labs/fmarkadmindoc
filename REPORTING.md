# Configure Reporting Requirements for Partners

Accelerate&trade; allows you to define reporting requirements about the type of data you would like to collect from them. Once configured, they will be able to access your requirements. They will then map their data collection process to yours.

## Accessing the page

To access this page, select "Activities" from the "Settings" menu. On this page, you will be able to create Templates and KPIs.

## Templates

Templates define the type of data you would like to collect. They will contain a name to describe the template and a number of fields each with a specific type. Although not shown when creating a template, when users submit data for a template, they will be asked for the location and time of the record. The platform currently supports the following data types.

##### Short Answer
A text input used to collect fields that are less than 50 characters. This is useful for capturing short fields like names of people, places and things.

##### Paragraph
A text input to capture larger amount of text input. This is useful for capturing longer descriptive responses.

#####  Number
A text input to capture numbers. This is currently the only field type that can be tracked in an KPI.

##### Date
An input where the user will be able to select from a Calendar. You do not need to ask when this event has happened because it is automatically asked as a field.

##### Multiple Choice
An input where the user will have radio buttons. They will be able to make one choice (You must specify at least option). This is useful for showing all the options and requesting the user to choose one.

##### Check Box
An input where the user will have checkboxes. They will able to select more than one option. You must specify at least option. There will be ![plus icon](https://d3e1wbkfmk6n2w.cloudfront.net/fa/plus.png "Plus Icon") for you to add at least one option.

##### Drop Down
Similar to Multiple Choice, the only difference is that the user is shown a drop down instead. They will be able to make one choice. You must specify at least option. There will be ![plus icon](https://d3e1wbkfmk6n2w.cloudfront.net/fa/plus.png "Plus Icon") for you to add at least one option.

## Suggested KPI

After creating a template, you can define a KPI to track the data collected from your Suggested template. One KPI will be created for each of the partners for which you created that template for.

##### Describing the KPI

You can provide a name and description for the KPI. This will give context to the KPI for the users on your platform.

##### Configuring how the KPI will run.

You can enable/disable the KPI by choosing the appropriate value from the Status Drop Down. While the KPI is Inactive, no data will be collected against the KPI and it will not appear on the Accelerate&trade; dashboard. You can also specify when you would like to start (Reporting From) collecting the data and how often (Reporting Period).

##### Configuring how the KPI will be calculated.

You will be able to select the template from which the data will come from. Once selected, you can select the type of calculation you want to make

* **Count** - Simply count the number of entries that have been made for this template
* **Sum** - Sum a number field within the template over the reporting period
* **Average** - Take the average of the values of a number field within the template over the reporting period.
* **Ratio** - Take a ratio of two number fields within the template over the reporting period.

For The last three types are only applicable for number fields. Once selected, you can enter the expected projected value you would like the KPI to be measured against.
